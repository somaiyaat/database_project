# ðŸŽ“ University Management System Database (Oracle SQL & PL/SQL)

This project is a **comprehensive University Management System** designed using **Oracle SQL and PL/SQL**.  
It integrates three main domains into one relational database:  

1. **University Management** (students, faculty, courses, exams, grades, finance)  
2. **Library Management** (books, authors, reservations, staff, book issue/return)  
3. **Transport Management** (routes, buses, student transport registration)  

The goal is to provide a unified database that handles the academic, administrative, and logistical needs of a university.
